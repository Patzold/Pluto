# Pluto

Pluto is a Python Libary for working with & analyzing screenshots.

The current master version includes basic import & OCR methods and the groundwork for the segmentation methods. A fully functioning version of Pluto with the first completed features is expected to be finished by the end of this month. You can also expect documentation and examples.
